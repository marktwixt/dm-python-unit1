# Let's assign variables to represent a book you enjoy.

# Step 2 - Strings
# Let's start with Python strings. Replace the "None" with the name of a book, and below the name of the author of your book.

book_name = "Foundation"
author = "Isaac Asimov"
# book_name = "Dune"
# author = "Frank Herbert"


# Step 3 - Concatenation and f-strings
# Use concatenation and f-strings to make a sentence about your author and book name.

sentence1 = book_name + " is written by " + author + "."
# sentence1 = book_name + " is written by " + author + "."
sentence2 = f"Author, {author}, wrote the book {book_name}."
# sentence2 = f"Author, {author}, wrote the book {book_name}."


# Step 4 - Integers
# Now let's practice Integers. Replace the "None" below with the publication date of your book.
publication_year = 1951
# publication_year = 1965


# Step 5 - Floats
# Now estimate what the retail value of your book would be at a store and replace the "None" below with a float value of the price. (Doesn't have to be accurate.)
book_price = 7.99
# book_price = 17.99


# Step 6 - Booleans
# Now we will practice with booleans. Replace the "is_awesome" variable with a boolean. True if your book is awesome, False if your book is not awesome.
is_awesome = True
# is_awesome = True


# Step 7 - print and type functions
# Follow the instructions, and below this line, code all of the suggested print statements and the type statements.
# Code below
# Print the variables
print(sentence1)
print(sentence2)
print("Publication Year:", publication_year)
print("Book Price:", book_price)
print("Is the book awesome?", is_awesome)

# Print the data types
print("Data type of book_name:", type(book_name))
print("Data type of author:", type(author))
print("Data type of publication_year:", type(publication_year))
print("Data type of book_price:", type(book_price))
print("Data type of is_awesome:", type(is_awesome))
