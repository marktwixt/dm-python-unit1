This code defines a search function called "search_books", which searches for books in a file called "library.txt" by default. 
The purpose of this function is to help users find books based on a keyword they provide, which can be either a part of the title or the author's name.

def search_books(filename="library.txt"): - 
This line defines the function and gives it a name: "search_books". The function accepts one parameter called "filename", which is set to "library.txt" by default. This means that if the user doesn't provide a specific file to search in, the function will look in the "library.txt" file.

query = input("Enter a search term (title or author): ").lower() - 
This line asks the user to enter a search term (either a part of a book title or an author's name). The entered text is then converted to lowercase and stored in a variable called "query".

books = load_books(filename) - 
This line calls another function named "load_books" and passes the "filename" parameter to it. 
The "load_books" function reads the file and returns a list of books, which is then stored in a variable called "books".

results = [book for book in books if query in book["title"].lower() or query in book["author"].lower()] - 
This line searches for books that match the given query. It goes through each book in the "books" list and 
checks if the query appears in either the book's title or author's name (both converted to lowercase). Matching books are then added to a new list called "results".

if not results: - 
This line checks if the "results" list is empty, meaning no matching books were found.

print(f"\nNo books found matching '{query}'.\n") - 
If the "results" list is empty, this line prints a message saying that no books were found matching the given query.

else: - 
This line indicates that the following block of code will be executed if the "results" list is not empty (i.e., some matching books were found).

print("\nSearch results:") - 
This line prints a message to indicate the beginning of the search results.

for index, book in enumerate(results, start=1): - 
This line sets up a loop that goes through each book in the "results" list. 
The "enumerate" function assigns a unique index number to each book, starting from 1.

print(f"{index}. {book['title']} by {book['author']} ({book['year']}) - Rating: {book['rating']}/5 - Pages: {book['pages']}") - 
Inside the loop, this line prints the details of each book in the search results. 
The details include the index number, book title, author, publication year, rating, and the number of pages.

In summary, the "search_books" function allows users to search for books by entering a 
keyword related to the book's title or author. The function then displays the matching books, along with their details.
